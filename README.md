# AI-Powered Lung Disease Diagnosis System

## Overview
This project was developed during the Discovery Hackathon as part of the Ctrl-Alt-Elite team. Our goal was to create an AI-powered system that assists in diagnosing lung diseases, such as pneumonia and tuberculosis, using advanced machine learning techniques.

## Features
- **AI Integration**: Utilizes EfficientNetB4 and other deep learning models for accurate lung disease diagnosis.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for General Practitioners, Radiologists, and Pulmonologists to manage patient records efficiently.
- **Automated Reports**: Generates detailed reports and treatment plans based on AI diagnosis.

## Project Details
- **Team Members**: Tasmiyah Nakooda, Ulysses, Zaid
- **Hackathon Achievement**: Selected as the top 3 teams after a 72-hour virtual competition, followed by a fully paid trip to Sandton for the final presentation.

## Technical Details
- **Frontend**: Streamlit for interactive UI.
- **Backend**: TensorFlow for AI model training and inference.
- **Database**: SQLite for storing patient records.
- **Other Tools**: Miro for user journey mapping.
